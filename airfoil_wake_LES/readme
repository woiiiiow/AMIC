DESCRIPTION
The Advection-based Multiframe Iterative Correction (AMIC) is a space-time filter based on advection funtion to filter the (Particle Image Velocimetry) PIV fields. Here is an example on 2D synthetic dataset of the wake of a wing model from a large eddy simulation (LES) database of University of Michigan library.

PLATFORM
The codes are tested on:
AMD Ryzen 9 5950X/128 GB DDR4
Debian 12/MATLAB R2023b
It takes 200 s for 10 loops for AMIC, and 80 s for pressure computation over 300 frames
