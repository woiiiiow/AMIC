DESCRIPTION
The Advection-based Multiframe Iterative Correction (AMIC) is a space-time filter based on advection funtion to filter the (Particle Image Velocimetry) PIV fields. Here is an example on 3D PIV (tomographic PIV) field of the wake of free jet at Re = 2800[1].

PLATFORM
The codes are tested on:
AMD Ryzen 9 5950X/128 GB DDR4/NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
Debian 12/MATLAB R2023b
For 1498 frames, it takes 2544 s to filter the velocity field, and 43262 s to finish the whole program.

RUNNING
1. changing the parameters to that of your case [line 4-23];
2. adjusting the data storage structure to fit your dataset [line 28-55];
3. confirming the variables to save [line 202-205].
4. running the code

FILES
AMIC_pressure.m                              MATLAB script to process the PIV field using AMIC and then compute pressure field
show_data.m                                  MATLAB script to observe the statistics of velocity field
show_pressure.m                              MATLAB script to observe the pressure field
