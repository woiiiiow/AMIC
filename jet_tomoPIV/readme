This is the code to filter the tomographic PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) field of free jet at Re = 2800 [1] using AMIC and compute the pressure field.
The main program is on AMIC_pressure.m
MATLAB script

before running:
1. typing in the parameters [line 4-23];
2. adjusting to the data storage structure of your dataset [line 28-55];
3. confirming the variables to save and the file name [line 202-205].

testing platform:
AMD Ryzen 9 5950X/128 GB DDR4/NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
Debian 12/MATLAB R2023b

for 1498 frames, it takes 2544 s to filter the velocity field, and 43262 s to finish the whole program.
