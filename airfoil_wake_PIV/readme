DESCRIPTION
The Advection-based Multiframe Iterative Correction (AMIC) is a space-time filter based on advection funtion to filter the (Particle Image Velocimetry) PIV fields. Here is an example on 2D PIV field of the wake of a wing model.

PLATFORM
The codes are tested on:
AMD Ryzen 9 5950X/128 GB DDR4/NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
Debian 12/MATLAB R2023b

DATABASE

RUNNING
use h52mat to change the format of data
change the file path to suit your environment and run
