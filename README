AMIC is a temporal-spatial filter for time-resolved PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) fields leveraging the advection function.

The codes of 4 cases included here:
Channel_DNS                     3D DNS dataset of wall bounded flow
airfoil_wake_LES                2D LES dataset of wake flow
airfoil_wake_PIV                2D PIV dataset of wake flow
jet_tomoPIV                     3D PIV dataset of jet

Interested viewers is suggested to use the codes in airfoil_wake_PIV/jet_tomoPIV for application.
The author are happy to help debug the code when the relative data can be open-sourced here.
