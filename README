AMIC is a temporal-spatial filter designed for time-resolved PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) fields that leverages the advection function. It aims to preserve flow details as much as possible and has been demonstrated to significantly enhance pressure estimation accuracy.

The codes of 4 cases included here:
Channel_DNS                     3D DNS dataset of wall bounded flow
airfoil_wake_LES                2D LES dataset of wake flow
airfoil_wake_PIV                2D PIV dataset of wake flow
jet_tomoPIV                     3D PIV dataset of jet

Interested viewers are encouraged to use the codes in airfoil_wake_PIV or jet_tomoPIV for application.
The authors are happy to assist with debugging the code if the relevant data can be open-sourced here.
